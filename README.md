# Features:
- Do /rcpclothing in the RedM chat to open the menu
- Click the X or press Escape to close
- Toggling the Blue Switch in the top right changes whether only 1 button gets highlighted when clicked or any of them
- Clicking the menu title resets the buttons back to their red colour
# Installation:
1. Make a folder called rcpclothing in your resources folder of your server (it has to be lower case)
2. Clone or download the files to that folder
3. Put start rcpclothing in the server.cfg, it is case sensitive so make sure it's the exact same as the folder name
# Issues/Bugs &amp; New Features:
If you find a bug, issue or error or if you want to request a new feature, [create an issue](https://github.com/RCPisAwesome/RedMRCPClothing/issues) with as much information as you can provide

The clothing is mostly unnamed and untested because there's 11,406 different options that I would have to go through which would be incredicly time consuming. I will update them all eventually but there are other projects I would like to be coding instead

If you ever get stuck in the menu from an issue you can do rcpuifix in the F8 console to close it if you have my Settings Menu installed

If your menu doesn't look like the screenshots (click on them to make sure its the latest image), delete your RedM cache except the game folder and your server cache too
